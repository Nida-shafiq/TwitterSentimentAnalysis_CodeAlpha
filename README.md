**Project Title: Twitter Sentiment Analysis using Machine Learning**

**Objective:**
This project aims to analyze the sentiments expressed in tweets and classify them into three categories: Positive, Negative, and Neutral. The analysis is performed using a combination of data preprocessing, feature extraction, and machine learning classification techniques.

**Overview:**
Twitter is a powerful platform for expressing opinions and emotions. Analyzing sentiments from tweets can help organizations and researchers understand public opinion on specific topics or events. This project utilizes machine learning to automatically classify tweet sentiments based on the textual content.

**Dataset:**
The analysis is based on two datasets: a training dataset and a validation dataset. Each dataset consists of tweet IDs, source, sentiment labels, and tweet text. The training dataset is used to build and train the machine learning model, while the validation dataset is used to evaluate its performance.

**Data Preprocessing:**
Before training, the tweet texts are cleaned to remove unnecessary elements such as mentions, links, special characters, and excessive white spaces. This ensures that only meaningful textual content is used for analysis.

**Sentiment Analysis Approach:**

**Text Cleaning:**
All tweets are cleaned using regular expressions to remove unwanted characters and ensure consistency.

**Feature Extraction:**
The cleaned tweets are transformed into numerical feature vectors using the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) technique, which captures the importance of each word in the context of the entire dataset.

**Model Training:**
A Logistic Regression model is trained on the TF-IDF feature vectors to learn patterns associated with each sentiment category.

**Prediction and Evaluation:**
The trained model is tested on both unseen validation data and user-input tweets to predict sentiments. Performance is evaluated using accuracy and classification metrics.

**Manual Analysis with TextBlob:**
A separate sentiment analysis using the TextBlob library is also included for reference and comparison, providing basic polarity-based sentiment classification.

**Results:**
The model demonstrates the ability to classify sentiments in tweets with reasonable accuracy. A percentage breakdown of each sentiment class is also provided for both training and validation datasets. Example tweets from each sentiment category are displayed to illustrate the modelâ€™s effectiveness.

**Applications:**
Monitoring public opinion on products, services, or events
